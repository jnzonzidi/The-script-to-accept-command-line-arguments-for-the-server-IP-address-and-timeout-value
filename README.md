# The-script-to-accept-command-line-arguments-for-the-server-IP-address-and-timeout-value

Now, users can run the script by providing the server IP address and timeout value as arguments:

./SSH test Address_IP and Timeout <server_ip>

For example:

./SSH test Address_IP and Timeout 192.168.1.100 5

This will attempt an SSH connection to the server with the IP address 192.168.1.100 and a timeout of 5 seconds. Adjust the timeout value according to your needs.
